Overloaded operators and implemented BigInt type that overcomes the range limitations of int type

# GoldRabbits

## Description
The assignment is to overload operators to for use in user-defined types. In this case, it is used for BigInt type where we store each digit of a number in reverse. The purpose of this assignment is to implement a user-defined type to overcome the range limitations of an int type in C++.

## Getting Started
To compile, type in the terminal: <br>
(Windows)
```
g++ -o app.exe main.cpp BigInt.cpp
```
(MacOS)
```
g++ -o app.out main.cpp BigInt.cpp
```
To run, double-click the executable or navigate to the working directory of executable and type:
```
./app
```

# GoldRabbits

## Description
The assignment involves overloading operators to use in user-defined types. In this scope, it is used on BigInt types which stores each digit of a number in reverse. The purpose of this assignment is to implement BigInt, a user-defined type, to overcome the range limitations of an int type in C++. By overloading operators for use in BigInt types, we can do arithmetic operations between two BigInt types and not worry about "integer overflow" errors.

## Getting Started
To compile, type in the terminal: <br>
(Windows)
```
g++ -o app.exe main.cpp BigInt.cpp
```
(MacOS)
```
g++ -o app.out main.cpp BigInt.cpp
```
To run, double-click the executable or navigate to the working directory of executable and type:
```
./app
```
